        <div class="animation">
        <p>Hey long time no see, <br>what are you been up to?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="animation">
        <p>Me? I’m doing good too.<br> Actually a little bit tired from work.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="animation">
        <p>It gets busier nowadays.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="animation">
        <p>By the way you wouldn’t believe this, <br>I actually saw the Space.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="animation">
        <p>No not in the movie, <br>on my way home.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="animation">
        <p>Hear me out.<br>After I get off my train, <br>just making my way home,</p>
        </div>

        <div class="animation">
        <p>I just kinda closed my eyes <br>enough to see a little. </p>
        </div>


        <div class="animation">
        <p>Well it is blurry but the way <br>I saw the city lights and the lampposts, <br>
            it really does looked-like the Space.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="animation">
        <p>You know these days, <br>
        like our normal days,<br>
        we just get off from our 9 to 5 work,<br>
        feeling very tired on the way home.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="animation">
            <p>Sometimes we pass our stops either<br />
            we’re asleep or our face is on the phone.</p>
        </div>

            
        <div class="animation">
            <p>But when you just lift<br />
            your face and take <br />
            a look around outside, </p>
        </div>

            
        <div class="animation">
            <p>the scenery with the countless<br>
                train windows passing through<br>
                from the opposite side looks<br>
            very vivid and it kinda <br>takes your breath away.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="animation">
            <p>A part of someone else’s lives passing<br />
            through a tremendous speed.</p>
        </div>

            
        <div class="animation">
            <p>Passing through with each <br>other countless times,</p>
        </div>

            
        <div class="animation">
            <p>I wonder if it will repeat <br>over and over again.</p>
        </div>

            
        <div class="animation">
            <p>Anyway back to what I’m talking <br>about earlier.</p>
        </div>

            
        <div class="animation">
            <p>The first time I glanced at that scene,<br />
            It made my day and it changes<br />
            my perspective on how I look on little things.</p>
        </div>

            
        <div class="animation">
            <p>I find it more amusing looking outside <br />
            the window on my way home.</p>
        </div>

            
        <div class="animation">
            <p>For me it’s the landscape that <br />
            I was looking for.</p>
        </div>

            
        <div class="animation">
            <p>Like when you go to a trip,<br />
            there’s these scenery outside that <br />
            you can glance and it’s like that.</p>
        </div>

            
        <div class="animation">
            <p>Even it is simple, <br />
            if you just change on how<br />
            you look a things you can find<br />
            your Galaxy anywhere and I<br />
            may have found mine.</p>
        </div>

            
        <div class="animation">
            <p>I know for sure that<br />
            I can’t go to the space and <br>explore the Galaxy,<br />
            But I can find my Galaxy here.</p>
        </div>

            
        <div class="animation">
            <p>You should try it next time. <br />
            Try following the light outside<br />
            the window on your way home.</p>
        </div>

            
        <div class="animation">
            <p>The flow of the light stretches and<br />
            does look like an abstract painting. <br />
            Can’t keep up with the pace though sometimes.</p>
        </div>

            
        <div class="animation">
            <p>It reminds of the feeling of <br>
                the moving body, <br />
            not only me but many <br>
            other people are moving<br />
            at a tremendous speed.</p>
        </div>

            
        <div class="animation">
            <p>I kinda chuckled about it the other day.</p>
        </div>

            
        <div class="animation">
            <p>The word [ MOVE ] have a lot of meaning<br />
            and has more thought than ever.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="animation">
            <p>You know, <br />
            Mankind has always been <br>
            moving forward and<br />
            I feel alive when I’m moving.</p>
        </div>

            
        <div class="animation">
            <p>With the stars in the galaxy that<br />
            keeps flowing around endlessly</p>
        </div>

            
        <div class="animation">
            <p>We the people who live here on earth,</p>
        </div>

            
        <div class="animation">
            <p>I wonder where it’s all connected.</p>
        </div>

            
        <div class="animation">
            <p>Gosh, I’ve talked too much.<br />
            I’m about to head out.</p>
        </div>

            
        <div class="animation">
            <p>Let’s go for a stroll next time if <br>
                we meet again.<br />
            </p>
